===========

Problems to overcome:
1.	How are we going to create the pieces?
  a.	Define class Piece, then derive different pieces from it?
  b.	Define classes King, Queenâ€¦, Pawn individually?
2.	Move validation?
  a.	Part of piece class?
  b.	Separate method just for this?
3.	AI?
  a.	Use the tried-and-true method from our checkers game?
    i.	Slow, we would need to optimize it much more
    ii.	No need to implement another
    iii.	Only need to rewrite the move-related methods
  b.	We could write another
    i.	Could we speed it up at all?

Problems already solved (above questions will be moved down here after they are solved):
